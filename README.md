## Information of each challenge folder
Every challenge folder will have a `README.md` file that details what the challenge is about and how to solve it. The following explains the folders and their role. 
- `distrib` contains all distributable files for all users
- `generate` contains all relevant source code used to generate the challenge (if not in service directory)
- `solution` contains all the solution scripts or files.
